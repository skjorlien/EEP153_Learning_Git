# README 

This is a sandbox repo to learn git and break things for EEP153.

## Day 1 
- Get setup with GitHub, ssh, Datahub
- Clone this repo
- Play with the modify->stage->commit workflow.
- Dive into the Git mental model
- Break things (just a little) 
- Introduce branches as a solution for group collaboration 
- Learn the pull->merge to main->push workflow


### Lessons from day 1
1. NEVER commit to main.
Commit to a feature branch then: pull latest main from remote, merge your feature branch to the latest main locally push main back to remote to update the "central version of the truth"
